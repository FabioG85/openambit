OPENAMBIT
=========

The openambit source repository contains of several parts.
Each part is briefly described below.
For now there is really no good reason for installing the
application, running it from the build directory is quite
sufficient. Thus, the building instructions below has left
out the installation parts.


src/libambit
============
The "driver" library as a shared object. Written in C.

Build instructions:
> mkdir libambit-build
> cd libambit-build
> cmake ../src/libambit
> make


src/openambit
=============
The GUI application. Uses the libambit library.
Built with qmake for now.

Build instructions:
First build libambit as instructed above
> mkdir openambit-build
> cd openambit-build
> qmake ../src/openambit
> make

Run the application:
> cd openambit-build
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../libambit-build ./openambit


tools/movescountXmlDiff.pl
==========================
Small Perl-script to compare XML-files generated by
openambit and Suuntos Moveslink. Basically a diff with
added floating point round errors ignored.


wireshark_dissector
===================
To ease the parsing of the protocol a wireshark dissector
is maintained. This dissector parses pcap-files made with
usbpcap. The parts of the protocol that is known atm
should be present in the latest dissector.

Build instructions:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> cp ambit.so ~/.wireshark/plugins
