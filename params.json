{"name":"Openambit","tagline":"Open software for the Suunto Ambit(2) ","body":"# Openambit\r\n\r\nThe Openambit source repository consists of several parts.\r\nEach part is briefly described below.\r\nMost people would like to use both the device communication\r\nlibrary (libambit) and the GUI (Openambit). The build / install\r\nscripts described below make your life easier if you are\r\nlike most people.\r\nYou can choose to run the GUI from the build folder or install\r\nit to your system.\r\n\r\n### Build script\r\nBuilds libambit and openambit in one command\r\n```\r\n> cd YOUR/git/REPO/location\r\n> ./build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build and install script\r\nBuilds and install libambit and openambit in one command.\r\nNote that the script will try to run sudo to install things.\r\n```\r\n> cd YOUR/git/REPO/location\r\n> ./install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nTo be able to build libambit and openambit the following libraries\r\n(and their header files) need to be available:\r\n* libudev\r\n* libusb\r\n* libqjson\r\n\r\nFor debian-based systems:\r\n```\r\n> sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libqjson-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### src/libambit\r\nThe \"driver\" library as a shared object. Written in C.\r\n\r\nBuild instructions:\r\n```\r\n> mkdir libambit-build\r\n> cd libambit-build\r\n> cmake ../src/libambit\r\n> make\r\n# Optionally:\r\n> sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### src/openambit\r\nThe GUI application. Uses the libambit library.\r\n\r\nBuild instructions:\r\nFirst build libambit as instructed above\r\n```\r\n> mkdir openambit-build\r\n> cd openambit-build\r\n> cmake ../src/openambit\r\n> make\r\n# Optionally:\r\n> sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the application without installing:\r\n```\r\n> cd openambit-build\r\n> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../libambit-build ./openambit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### tools/movescountXmlDiff.pl\r\nSmall Perl-script to compare XML-files generated by\r\nopenambit and Suuntos Moveslink. Basically a diff with\r\nadded floating point round errors ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n### wireshark_dissector\r\nTo ease the parsing of the protocol a wireshark dissector\r\nis maintained. This dissector parses pcap-files made with\r\nusbpcap. The parts of the protocol that is known atm\r\nshould be present in the latest dissector.\r\n\r\nBuild instructions:\r\n```\r\n> mkdir build\r\n> cd build\r\n> cmake ..\r\n> make\r\n> cp ambit.so ~/.wireshark/plugins\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
